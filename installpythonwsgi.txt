 tried following Carl's answer, but it didn't solve the problem. It turns out that the version I installed required some extra configuration steps after installation.
Background

I looked at Apache's modules folder before I installed the mod_wsgi upgrade:

$ ls -l /lib64/httpd/modules
[...]
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 172800 Oct 30 22:44 mod_wsgi.so

Then I installed the SCL repository, and looked to see which versions of mod_wsgi are available.

$ sudo yum install -q -y centos-release-scl
[...]
$ yum search mod_wsgi
[...]
koschei-frontend.noarch : Web frontend for koschei using mod_wsgi
mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
python27-mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
python33-mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
rh-python34-mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
rh-python35-mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
rh-python36-mod_wsgi.x86_64 : A WSGI interface for Python web applications in Apache
viewvc-httpd-wsgi.noarch : ViewVC configuration for Apache/mod_wsgi
[...]

I'm using Python 3.6, so I installed the matching version and restarted Apache.

$ sudo yum install -q -y rh-python36-mod_wsgi
[...]
$ sudo systemctl restart httpd

Sadly, that didn't solve the problem. When I looked in Apache's modules folder, nothing had changed. Weird!

$ ls -l /lib64/httpd/modules
[...]
-rwxr-xr-x. 1 root root 172800 Oct 30 22:44 mod_wsgi.so

So what did get installed?

$ rpm -ql rh-python36-mod_wsgi
/opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/10-rh-python36-wsgi.conf
/opt/rh/httpd24/root/usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_rh-python36-wsgi.so
/opt/rh/rh-python36/root/usr/share/doc/rh-python36-mod_wsgi-4.5.18
/opt/rh/rh-python36/root/usr/share/doc/rh-python36-mod_wsgi-4.5.18/CREDITS.rst
/opt/rh/rh-python36/root/usr/share/doc/rh-python36-mod_wsgi-4.5.18/LICENSE
/opt/rh/rh-python36/root/usr/share/doc/rh-python36-mod_wsgi-4.5.18/README.rst

Extra Configuration Steps

It installed the files I need, but it didn't put them anywhere useful. With some hints from the README.rst file, I copied them into the right place.

sudo cp /opt/rh/httpd24/root/usr/lib64/httpd/modules/mod_rh-python36-wsgi.so /lib64/httpd/modules
sudo cp /opt/rh/httpd24/root/etc/httpd/conf.modules.d/10-rh-python36-wsgi.conf /etc/httpd/conf.modules.d
sudo systemctl restart httpd
